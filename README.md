# mf4-to-csv-converter

⚠️ Note: Due to confidentiality, sample .mf4 data is not included.

This script was built to automate the conversion of MDF4 files (used in automotive measurement systems) to CSV using the `asammdf` Python library.

## Usage
1. Install the required library:
pip install asammdf

2. Run the script:
python convert_mf4_to_csv.py


Make sure your `.mf4` file is in the same folder. Output will be saved as `output.csv`.
